# Bentley Website Clone

This repository contains a clone of the Bentley website, created as a part of my learning journey in web development. While this clone may not be responsive, the project has provided me with valuable insights into working with Flexbox, CSS properties, and HTML structure.

## Project Overview

### Technologies Used:
- HTML
- CSS (Flexbox)

### Key Learnings:

- **Flexbox Mastery:** The project allowed me to deepen my understanding of Flexbox, a powerful layout model in CSS. I explored how to efficiently organize and structure content on the webpage using Flexbox properties.

- **CSS Styling Techniques:** Through the process of replicating the Bentley website, I honed my CSS skills by applying various styling techniques. This includes working with backgrounds, fonts, margins, paddings, and more.

- **HTML Structure:** Understanding the structure of the original Bentley website and translating it into well-organized HTML code was an integral part of this project. This experience enhanced my proficiency in crafting semantic and accessible HTML markup.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that represents the structure of the cloned Bentley website.
- `style.css`: The CSS file containing the styles for the project, with a primary focus on Flexbox layouts.
